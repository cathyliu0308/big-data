In computing, a virtual machine (VM) is an emulation of a computer system.
Virtual machines are based on computer architectures and provide functionality of a physical computer.
Their implementations may involve specialized hardware, software, or a combination.
There are different kinds of virtual machines, each with different functions:
System virtual machines (also termed full virtualization VMs) provide a substitute for a real machine.
They provide functionality needed to execute entire operating systems.
A hypervisor uses native execution to share and manage hardware, allowing for multiple environments
which are isolated from one another, yet exist on the same physical machine.
Modern hypervisors use hardware-assisted virtualization, virtualization-specific hardware, primarily from the host CPUs.
Process virtual machines are designed to execute computer programs in a platform-independent environment.
Some virtual machines, such as QEMU,
are designed to also emulate different architectures
and allow execution of software applications and operating systems written for another CPU or architecture.
Operating-system-level virtualization allows the resources of a computer to be partitioned via the kernel's support
for multiple isolated user space instances, which are usually called containers and may look and feel like real machines to the end users.
